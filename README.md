### Hi there, I'm Kaif
I'm a software engineer based in Glasgow and currently between jobs.

- ⚡ I'm a huge fan of Linux, cloud platforms, open source and efforts to improve accessibility.
- 🔧 I'm always tweaking my [configuration and dotfiles](https://github.com/brotherkaif/config).
- 🌱 I'm interested in dipping my toes into game development as a hobby and have been experimenting with [Godot](https://godotengine.org/).
